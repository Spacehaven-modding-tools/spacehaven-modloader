Adjust stats for all engines using multipliers.

"Mass Capacity" is self explanatory.

"Fuel Boost" increases or decreases fuel efficiency.
For example, if you want double the number of jumps per Fuel, set the "Fuel Boost" to 2.
A non-cheaty way to fill your engines with all of your fuel is to set "Fuel Boost" to 0.01, open the game, let logistics max the engines, save &amp; exit, then set "Fuel Boost" back to 1.

"How Much" and "How Often" change how much fuel is used and how often that amount is used, respectively.

Only enter numeric values.
Clear quicklaunch file after changing values.

Post on Discord if anything doesn't work as described.
